# WordPanel 🚀

**WordPanel** is a lightweight, modern web interface for [WordOps](https://wordops.net/), designed to simplify WordPress server management. Built with **FastAPI**, **HTMX**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it provides a streamlined dashboard for deploying sites, managing assets, and handling server administration without touching the command line.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🖥️ Site Dashboard:** View all WordOps sites, SSL status, and PHP/Cache types at a glance.
* **⚡ One-Click WP-Admin:** deeply integrated "Auto-Login" button that generates a magic link to any site's WordPress dashboard.
* **📦 Asset Vault:** Upload and manage premium `.zip` plugins and themes centrally on the server.
* **🚀 Smart Deployment:**
* Create sites with Nginx FastCGI or Redis Cache stacks.
* **Hybrid Installer:** specific plugins from the WordPress Repository *and* your local Asset Vault simultaneously during site creation.
* Auto-activate selected plugins upon deployment.


* **👥 Team Management:** Create multiple administrator accounts with secure authentication (Argon2 hashing).
* **🔒 Security:** JWT-based stateless authentication and protected routes.
* **🛠️ System Integration:** Runs as a native systemd service (`wordpanel.service`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.12 + FastAPI
* **Database:** SQLite (Lightweight, file-based storage)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS (Styling), HTMX (Dynamic interactions), Alpine.js (Modal logic)

## 📥 Installation

WordPanel is distributed as a custom Debian package.

### 1. Build the Package

Navigate to the parent directory of your source code:

```bash
# Structure should be:

dpkg-deb --build wordpanel-1.0

```

### 2. Install the Package

```bash
sudo apt install ./wordpanel-1.0.deb

```

*During installation, the package will automatically create a secure Python virtual environment in `/opt/wordpanel/venv`, install dependencies, and start the systemd service.*

### 3. Firewall Setup

Ensure port **8000** is open on your server:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp
sudo ufw reload

```
